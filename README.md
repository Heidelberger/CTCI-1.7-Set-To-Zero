# CTCI 1.7 Set To Zero
## Cracking the Coding Interview
### Chapter 1, Problem 1.7

Work in 2 passes. All modifications are in-place.

Complexity: 

Algorithm runs in O(N) time. Every element is touched once to check for zero. If zeros are found, then the elements in that column and row are set to zero.

Algorithm requires O(N) space. All elements are stored in memory once. Edits are in-place.
